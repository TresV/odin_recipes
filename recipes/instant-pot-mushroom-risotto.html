    <h1>Instant Pot Mushroom Risotto</h1>
    <p>This creamy Instant Pot risotto with softened mushrooms and a sprinkling of cheese will seem like a dish ordered at a restaurant instead of made at home. Traditionally risotto is made slowly, stirring often, adding a bit of hot stock at a time, then more stirring. It's a labor-intensive process that's worth the fuss for the finished product. However, risotto made in a pressure cooker is so simple and quick that it feels like cheating. It's not. This is the real stuff. You'll probably start making risotto far more often after you try this one.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step <br> Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Add butter and olive oil; stir until butter melts, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in onion; cook for 2 minutes. Add rosemary sprig; cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Step <br> Stir rice into the pot until each grain is coated with butter and olive oil mixture, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine; simmer for 3 minutes. Pour in chicken stock, stirring to scrape the sides of the pot. Simmer for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Step <br> Close and lock the lid. Turn the venting knob to sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Step <br> Tap venting knob a few times with a wooden spoon or spatula. Stand back; turn knob to point at vent. Remove lid when pressure is released, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Step <br> Stir risotto until creamy, about 1 minute. Discard rosemary sprig. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and combined.</li>
